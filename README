This is a basic template for running an SPA app w/Angularjs using Flask as the backend.
For some reason, I didn't find many examples of how to pull data from a datbase to send to
the Angular controller. So, here you go. I hope this helps someone out.

All the magic happens in app.py in get_entries(). First, the $http service from Angular 
calls for the page /wanteddata. Flask responds by running get_entries(). It grabs all the 
data in a table, creates a dictionary of columns:data, turns that into JSON, then returns
the JSON to the controller where Angular takes back control.

- Uses Python 3.3. 
- The Angular min library is in static/lib/angular. You might want to replace that
    with a more recent version. Or not.
- Left in a single table sqlite database of random names and other data so you can get started.

To start, simply run python app.py
